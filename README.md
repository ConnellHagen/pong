# About
 
This is a recreation of the Atari game 'Pong' as a practice exercise in creating games using the SDL2 graphics library of C++.

I have (or will have) added many features that were not within the capabilities of the original Atari game such as:
* Animated textures
* Ball rotations
* Multiple maps to play on

# Preview

This is just the prototype in the current phase of development. This is subject to change

# Installation

This project is not complete enough that I have set up an executable yet.

If you would like to test out what is currently finished, the following are the dependant libraries:
* SDL2
* SDL2_Image
* SDL2_TTF
