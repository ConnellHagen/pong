# About
 
This is a recreation of the Atari game 'Pong' as a practice exercise in creating games using the SDL2 graphics library of C++.

I have added many features that were not within the capabilities of the original Atari game such as:
* Animated textures
* Ball rotations
* Multiple maps to play on

This is just the prototype in the current phase of development. This is subject to change

# Installation

* This project has a long way to go until it is ready for distribution.
* Kindly look away if you accidently install and run it properly. :)
